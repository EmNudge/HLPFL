Ricardo Rosell\u00f3 said. Until the recent update, Puerto Rico's government had said only 64 people died as a result of the storm.\n    Puerto Rico&#39;s new Hurricane Maria death toll is 46 times higher than the government&#39;s previous count\n    Puerto Rico's new Hurricane Maria death toll is 46 times higher than the government's previous count\n    The Great Galveston Hurricane of 1900 remains the deadliest recorded hurricane in US history.\n    Thousands of homes in the city of Galveston, Texas were reduced to rubble by a hurricane on Sept. 8, 1900. \n    Thousands of homes in the city of Galveston, Texas were reduced to rubble by a hurricane on Sept. 8, 1900.\n    When it made landfall on September 8, 1900, it destroyed thousands of homes and killed at least 8,000 people within hours. The hurricane hit the Texas port city by surprise and had such a massive impact that it \"brought a new focus on the study of hurricane prediction,\" the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said.\n    All three of the deadliest hurricanes were Category 4 storms when they made landfall.\n    Deadly estimates in the spotlight\n    News organizations and some members of Congress have raised questions about the official death toll in Puerto Rico, which had remained at 64 for months.\n    CNN reporters surveyed about half of the funeral homes across the island and found that funeral home directors identified 499 deaths they considered to be hurricane-related. In December, The New York Times estimated 1,052 \"excess deaths\" occurred after Maria. Others produced similar estimates.\n    Democrats in the House, including some Hispanic Caucus members, have requested an investigation into the Trump administration's response to Hurricane Maria.\n    In June, Democratic Rep. Nydia Vel\u00e1zquez called for a commission similar to one established in the aftermath of 9/11 to look into the storm's \"death toll, the federal response and how FEMA and other agencies may have responded sluggishly based on artificially low numbers.\"\n    CNN's Leyla Santiago, Catherine E. Shoichet and Jason Kravarik contributed to this report.\n    "

    "article": "\nJACKSONVILLE, N.C. \u2014 A tsunami-like storm surge from Hurricane Dorian ripped through North Carolina\u2019s Outer Banks on Friday \u2014 a towering wall of water that left residents trapped and powerless. A strong tropical storm once again exposed the vulnerabilities of the narrow barrier islands in an era of extreme weather and rising seas.\n\nThe hurricane that had swooped along the Eastern Seaboard for days made landfall at Cape Hatteras as a Category 1 storm, far weaker than when it was a Category 5 behemoth that delivered a marathon assault on the Bahamas earlier in the week.\n\nBut in this low-lying community built on a foundation of shifting sand, Dorian was still severe enough to cause an \u201cabsolute major disaster,\u201d said Peter Vankevich, a resident of Ocracoke Island, along the southern stretch of the Outer Banks.\n\n\n[Capital Weather Gang: Dorian exits Mid-Atlantic, heads north]\n\nThe hurricane wrought much of its destruction through swift and severe storm surge from the Pamlico Sound, the long lagoon that separates the islands from the North Carolina mainland. Powerful winds sucked water away from the coast, then pushed it back in a massive wave onto the western sides of Hatteras and Ocracoke islands. In less than two hours, tide gauges measured a water level increase of more than seven feet \u2014 enough to submerge a home\u2019s first-floor windows.\n\n\u201cThe water just poured in and has continued to do so,\u201d said Vankevich, who runs the Ocracoke Observer, the island\u2019s main news source. \u201cIf you were out there walking around, you could have been swept away.\u201d\n\nHurricane Dorian traps North Carolina island residents\nAfter Hurricane Dorian made landfall on the Outer Banks, North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper (D) voiced concern for \"hundreds of people trapped on Ocracoke Island.\" (Reuters)\nBy early afternoon, the storm\u2019s eyewall had moved northwest and away from shore. It is expected to scrape by southeastern New England on Saturday, then strike parts of Nova Scotia and Newfoundland before it finally spins out into the North Atlantic after a long and deadly slog across the hemisphere.\n\n\nDorian began brewing into one of the strongest hurricanes on record more than a week ago, prompting panicked preparations in Florida and north through the Carolinas. But it was the Bahamas that bore the brunt of the storm\u2019s fury; the tempest stalled for 40 hours directly over the island chain, laying waste to much of two of its northern territories \u2014 Great Abaco and Grand Bahama. The official death toll stood at 43 Friday night but that is likely to be just a fraction of the total death toll, as entire communities were decimated by storm surges that topped 20 feet and winds that gusted to 220 mph.\n\nThousands of Bahamians made homeless by the storm are squatting in broken, abandoned homes or are scrambling for floor space in shelters without steady food and water.\n\nWith bodies still in the streets, Bahamians look for a way out of Marsh Harbour\nMarsh Harbour was ground zero when Hurricane Dorian hit the Bahamas. One week later, amid rubble and human remains, Bahamians grow desperate and frustrated. (Video: Zoeann Murphy, Jon Gerberg/Photo: Carolyn Van Houten/The Washington Post)\nWhen Dorian finally dislodged and swerved north Tuesday, the storm skirted the U.S. coastline, its outer edges scraping by Florida, Georgia and most of the Carolinas. In southeastern North Carolina, where many are still recovering from the devastation caused by Hurricane Florence last year, residents were relieved to escape the worst of it this time.\n\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re looking at what\u2019s going on in the Bahamas, and you see this massive storm heading right for you, you\u2019re going to be getting worried,\u201d said Tony Catullo, a Myrtle Beach, S.C., resident who spent Friday afternoon sunbathing along the shore. After days of doom-filled forecasts, the mood here was relaxed: The local country radio station was advertising live music and the \u201cpremier hurricane party.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe dodged a bullet here,\u201d Catullo said.\n\n\nA man and a woman walk past the Riggings condo complex the morning after Hurricane Dorian passed by the area on Friday, in Kure Beach, N.C. (Elijah Nouvelage for The Washington Post)\nPeople in Wilmington, N.C., returned home Friday morning to surf beneath clearing skies. In Onslow County, to the north, swiftwater rescuers had little work to do.\n\n\u201cThis ain\u2019t nothing,\u201d said Thomas Goff, of Onslow Fire and Rescue. \u201cI\u2019ve seen pop-up thunderstorms do more damage.\u201d\n\nNo serious injuries or fatalities from the hurricane have been reported in the United States, though North Carolina and Florida officials have listed other deaths that appear related to storm preparations and evacuations, including a man who fell from a ladder and people who collapsed under the stress of relocating. As of Friday morning, 75 roads were closed across North Carolina as the storm lashed the coastline \u2014 compared with the 750 road closures reported at the same time during Hurricane Florence last year.\n\n\nVirginia\u2019s Hampton Roads region experienced some limited flooding during high tide on Friday, but there was little effect from the storm\u2019s waning winds.\n\nWilliam Stiles, head of Wetlands Watch, a local nonprofit focusing on sea-level rise, was out mapping flooding in Norfolk on Friday.\n\n\u201cThis one was just weird,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was just the water. Not the wind. Not the howling horizontal rain we normally get with a hurricane.\u201d\n\nThe threat of flash flooding still loomed, though. And as reports of devastation emerged from the overwhelmed Outer Banks, North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper (D) noted that many people are still at risk.\n\nPhotos and video from Ocracoke showed swift-moving, white-capped water rushing through neighborhoods and spilling over window sills. Emergency officials urged people to stay indoors and move to the highest points in their homes.\n\n\nThough a mandatory evacuation order had been issued for Dare County, many in the Outer Banks opted to remain in their homes. Longtime residents, who can recite the names of past hurricanes like a list of bad exes, are accustomed to weathering storms.\n\n\nTornado damage associated with Hurricane Dorian is seen Friday at the Boardwalk RV Park in Emerald Isle, N.C., the day after Hurricane Dorian passed through the area. (Elijah Nouvelage for The Washington Post)\n\nA man exits a mobile home in Emerald Isle amid damage from a tornado. (Elijah Nouvelage for The Washington Post)\n\nHurricane Dorian spun off tornadoes, which damaged Boardwalk RV Park. (Elijah Nouvelage for The Washington Post)\nThe beach communities \u2014 accessible only by bridge, boat or plane even in the best of weather \u2014 became all but unreachable as 90 mph winds and torrential rain battered the coastline. An estimated 800 people who did not evacuate remained stranded without power. Emergency responders were forced to wait for the weather to break before they could deliver aid and rescue people via helicopter.\n\nHyde County officials helped airlift several people with medical issues and spent Friday evening canvassing neighborhoods to ensure other residents were safe. But many were waiting to leave, hoping that regular ferry service would soon be restored.\n\n\nThe Outer Banks have always been especially vulnerable to rough weather. The string of peninsulas and barrier islands, 200 miles long and never more than three miles wide, are the first land masses to be bombarded by water and wind coming off the Atlantic. The ocean regularly overtops dunes and washes out much of Highway 12 \u2014 the only road linking Hatteras Island and the rest of Dare County. The ferry from Hatteras to Ocracoke had to change routes after its usual run began filling in with sand. During strong storms, water will carve out new inlets and wash away acres of beach.\n\nFor years, the island chain has been slowly shifting west, toward the mainland, beaten back by the encroaching sea. Dorian clipped its southern reaches before launching eastward.\n\nThese alterations are nature\u2019s way of redistributing the tremendous energy of the ocean, explained Kitty Hawk resident Reide Corbett, a coastal oceanographer at East Carolina University and executive director of the Coastal Studies Institute in Manteo. The term \u201cbarrier islands\u201d refers to the way these landforms protect coastlines through their shapeshifting.\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a dynamic system,\u201d Corbett said. The resilience of the North Carolina coastline \u2014 not to mention some 30,000 year-round residents and a billion-dollar tourism industry \u2014 depend on it.\n\n\nUtility workers fix power lines the morning after Hurricane Dorian passed through Carolina Beach, N.C. (Elijah Nouvelage for The Washington Post)\nYet climate change has pushed the system to its limits. Rising sea levels have created a higher floor for storm surge to ride on top of, producing more frequent and more catastrophic floods.\n\n\u201cThe water levels in the ocean and the sound are changing,\u201d Corbett said. \u201cWhen you have 100 mile per hour winds blowing it up against the island, there\u2019s no place for it to go but inundate.\u201d\n\nThe scientist has noticed his neighbors become increasingly concerned about the fate of their islands. Efforts to \u201crenourish\u201d beaches with additional sand are washed away by the next storm. Rows of homes that once looked out onto the ocean have been lost to the incoming waters.\n\n\nCooper acknowledged the threat posed to his state by climate change while visiting a feeding station in Wilmington on Friday.\n\n\u201cWe know these storms now, unfortunately, are a new normal for us. We\u2019ve had three hurricanes in the state of North Carolina in less than three years,\u201d he said, in a nod to Florence and 2016\u2019s Hurricane Matthew. \u201cWe have a lot to do to become more resilient. We have a lot to do to rebuild not only stronger but smarter.\u201d\n\nKitty Hawk resident John Trubich, who waited out Dorian\u2019s downpour in the same home where he endured countless other storms, was more resigned. The future, he said, is in the hands of Mother Nature.\n\n\u201cThe Outer Banks was made by wind and water,\u201d he said. \u201cEventually, they\u2019ll take it away.\u201d\n"

    "article": "\nSeriously, Puerto Rico is a Caribbean paradise. Forget the Bahamas\u2014just look at the pictures for yourself. Dreamy beaches, palm trees, old Spanish forts, jungles, waterfalls, tropical drinks, delicious seafood\u2014Puerto Rico has it all. I mean, come on\u2014did you know there are rainforests in the USA? It\u2019s no wonder they call it The Island of Enchantment. \n\nPro tip: For insider info on all the most amazing gems Puerto Rico has to offer (especially local favorites and off-the-beaten-path treasures), connect with a Puerto Rican local for help creating your Puerto Rico itinerary.\n\n#2. You don\u2019t need a passport to travel to Puerto Rico\nPeople often forget that Puerto Rico is a US territory. That means that you don't need a passport to go there\u2014just the same ID you\u2019d need to fly anywhere else in the US.\n\n#3. You don\u2019t even need to change your money\nBecause Puerto Rico is a US territory, they also use the US dollar. That means you don't have to exchange your money, and you don\u2019t have to pay foreign transaction fees when using your credit or debit cards. Essentially, traveling to Puerto Rico couldn't be easier\u2014some cellular carriers don\u2019t even charge roaming.\n\nNot the tour group type?\n\nNeither are we. Have a local plan your trip to Puerto Rico.\n\n#4. Most areas have fully recovered from Hurricane Maria\nOne of the worst disasters in US history, Hurricane Maria claimed the lives of over 3,000 American citizens in 2017. And despite well-publicized issues with federal relief efforts, Puerto Rico has since largely recovered from the tragedy (aside from some very remote areas of the island). Which brings us to our final and most important point:\n\n#5. One of the easiest ways to help the people of Puerto Rico? Spend your tourism dollars there.\nNo kidding; Puerto Rico is, on the whole, one of the least wealthy areas of the US. And since the tragedy of Hurricane Maria, things have only gotten harder. So aside from donating to charity,  one of the best ways anyone can help the people of Puerto Rico is by putting money directly into the island's economy.\n\nTravel to Puerto Rico and help support the economy\n\nNote: When a ViaHero local helps you plan your trip, 70% of the cost goes directly to the Puerto Rican local doing the planning.\n\n#6. English is widely spoken\nAgain, Puerto Rico is a US territory. This means that while Spanish is the most popular language on the island, English is an official second language and many people speak it perfectly\u2014so getting around is a breeze, and it\u2019s easy to experience the incredible local culture.\n\n#7. The food is to die for\nTravel to Puerto Rico and eat delicious food\n\nPuerto Rico's cuisine is an absolutely mouth-watering mix of Spanish, Caribbean, African, and Asian influences. The fresh seafood is unparalleled (you have to try the aguacate relleno\u2014avocado stuffed with creamy garlic shrimp), and the island grows some of the best coffee, vegetables, and tropical fruit in the entire world. Oh, and did we mention that Puerto Rico is the world\u2019s second-largest producer of rum? Well, we\u2019re mentioning it again. Because rum.\n\n#8. It\u2019s super safe for travelers \nLike any major city, San Juan (the capital of Puerto Rico) has its neighborhoods to avoid. That said, it\u2019s really easy to stay safe in Puerto Rico with a little bit of know-how from a local. As Puerto Rico heavily relies on tourism, the police are very attentive and the island is very, very safe on the whole\u2014just take the same precautions you would in any other city.\n\n#9. Flights are really cheap\nDespite its small size, Puerto Rico has over two dozen airports with cheap, daily flights from all over the US and beyond. All the major US airlines fly there (United, American, Delta, JetBlue, Virgin, Southwest, and even Spirit). Plus, fares are ridiculously inexpensive\u2014sometimes as low as $60.\n\n#10. The people are wonderful\nTravel to Puerto Rico and meet wonderful people\n\nWhile it's never good to generalize, Puerto Ricans often pride themselves on their warm, vibrant culture. They did invent salsa dancing, after all. Which brings us to our next point\u2026\n\n#11. The music and dancing are absolutely incredible\nLike its food, Puerto Rico's music and dance are a dynamic mix of cultural influences. Salsa dancing was actually invented by Puerto Ricans in 1970\u2019s New York; the Bomba and the Danza, two other popular Puerto Rican dances, were invented on the island hundreds of years ago. And if you think the dancing is incredible, you have to check out the music scene.\n\n#12. Transportation is really easy\nOnce you\u2019re in Puerto Rico, transportation couldn't be easier. You can rent a car (remember: Puerto Rico is a US territory, so it has all the same car rental places as in the continental US), take public transportation, or just use Uber.\n\n#13. It\u2019s great for families\nWith its incredible beaches, kid-friendly resorts, and Pirates of the Caribbean-like atmosphere of San Juan, Puerto Rico couldn\u2019t be a better place to take the whole family. Plus, it\u2019s only a 3-hour flight from NYC\u2014so it\u2019s an easy trip for the little ones.\n\n#14. Solo female travelers love Puerto Rico\nSolo female travelers enjoy travel to Puerto Rico\n\nThough its culture is all its own, Puerto Rico\u2019s basic social boundaries are the same as in the US. That means that catcalling and harassment issues are similar to those in the states. The violent crime rate, however, is considerably lower in Puerto Rico than in nearly any US state.\n"
